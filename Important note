The Training method used here for the Haar Cascade file is setting up a linux server that trains the vector file over the background files.
You can do it on Windows but Linux is much faster as compared, Mac can also be used.
To see how to setup a Linux server visit Digital Ocean with hourly server rent and downlaod the OpenCV library and other required compoments after which you are ready to go. :D
For Image searching use any site though I'd prefer Imagenet.org that directly provides links for the images which is the required criteria.
One Important point:
There maybe some images in the negative that are of no use, like maybe a broken link produced a broken a broken image or something of that sort.
It is not necessarily important to remove those images though it can be done by using one broken image as a tmplate and match with the other same broken images and then collectively delete them.
